# Chess-Game
A functional chess game with a static GUI featuring the original pieces and two custom ones.
This project was fully developed using Eclipse.
If you are interested in running it, please download the file and open it in Eclipse to build from there.
I've provided JUnit tests for each of the pieces (including custom pieces) and the board as well to ensure that it works properly.
